- The timer runs for the time set in the settings
  - Choose between 2 and 3 minutes (default 2 minutes).
- The interval between quacks can be set (10, 20, 30 or 60 seconds; defaults to every 20 seconds).
- The duck quacks twice at the halfway point (if the interval set means the duck will quack halfway through).
- At the end of the time the duck quacks 10 times unless you stop it.
